 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * If the caller of the function used to create the object passed to it a type
 * pointer, that type WILL NOT be freed. Otherwise, if the type has been created
 * by the create function (e.g. sysfs_create_custom_obj()), then it will be
 * freed.
 *
 * The same rule applies to `prop_data` array: often, it's allocated by the
 * create function and there will be freed by this function. In the special
 * cases (e.g. sysfs_create_obj_va_arr) where the caller passed the `prop_data`
 * array to the sysfs create function, the `prop_data` will not be freed.
 *
 * In the most generic case where the sys object has been created outside of
 * sysfs and it has been initialized with sysobj_init(), clearly the caller owns
 * everything and MUST NOT call sysfs_destroy_unregistered_obj().
