### What is Tilck?
`Tilck` is an educational *monolithic* kernel designed to be Linux-compatible at
binary level. It runs on i686 and RISCV64 at the moment. Project's small-scale
and simple design makes it the **perfect playground** for playing in kernel mode
while retaining the ability to compare how the *very same* *usermode bits* run on
the Linux kernel as well. That's a **rare feature** in the realm of educational
kernels. Because of that, building a program for Tilck requires just a `gcc-musl`
toolchain from [bootlin.com](https://toolchains.bootlin.com). Tilck has **no need**
to have its own set of custom written applications, like most educational kernels do.
It just runs mainstream Linux programs like the **BusyBox** suite. While the
Linux-compatibility and the monolithic design might seem a limitation from the OS
research point of view, on the other side, such design bring the whole project much
closer to *real-world* applications in the future, compared to the case where some
serious (or huge) effort is required to port pre-existing software on it. Also, nothing
stops Tilck from implementing custom non-Linux syscalls that aware apps might take
advantage of.

#### Future plans
In the long term, `Tilck` might become widespread for **embedded systems** on
which a fully deterministic and ultra low-latency system is required. 
With a fair amount of luck, `Tilck` might be able to fill the gap between
*Embedded Linux* and typical real-time operating systems like *FreeRTOS* or
*Zephyr*. The kernel already runs on RISCV64 and at some point it will be ported
to the `ARM` family. It might be adapted to run on MMU-less CPUs as well. Tilck
would be a perfect fit for such use cases because consuming a tiny amount of RAM
has always been a key point in Tilck's design. Indeed, the kernel can boot and
run on a QEMU machine with just 3 MB of memory *today*. 

In addition to that, adding a basic support for networking and storage is part of
the plans even if details have not been defined yet. Networking support might be
limited to UDP + IP (at least at the beginning) and usable on a limited set of
network cards. The same applies for storage: not all kinds of block devices will
be supported, and a few filesystems (maybe just fat32 and ext2) will implemented
in the kernel. The support for FUSE filesystems will be considered.

One major milestone for the project will be to support both networking and storage
for a specific SoC like Raspberry Pi 3 (or 4) but that could possibly happen only
after Tilck has been ported to ARM64.

### What Tilck is NOT ?
 * An attempt to re-write and/or replace the Linux kernel. Tilck is a completely
different kernel that has a *partial* compatibility with Linux just in order to
take advantage of its programs and toolchains. Also, that helps a lot to validate
its correctness: if a program works correctly on Linux, it must work the same way
on Tilck as well (minus not-implemented features). **But**, having a fair amount
of Linux programs working on it, is just a *starting point*: with time, Tilck
will evolve in a different way and it will have its own unique set of features as
well.

* A kernel suitable for a *desktop* operating system. No X server works on Tilck,
not only because a considerable amount of extra features will be required for that,
but because working in that direction is *completely outside* of project's goals.

#### Tilck vs Linux
Tilck is fundamentally different from Linux as it **does not** aim to target
multi-user server nor desktop machines, at all because that would be pointless:
Linux is **not** big & complex because of a *poor* implementation, but because
of the incredible amount of features it offers and the *intrinsic* complexity they
require. In other words, **Linux is great** given the problem it solves. Tilck will
offer *fewer* features in exchange for:

 - simpler code (by far)
 - smaller binary size
 - extremely deterministic behavior
 - ultra low-latency
 - easier development & testing
 - extra robustness

In conclusion, while this is still an *educational* project at the moment, it has been
written keeping in mind those goals and it has a test infrastructure that ambitiously
tries to be almost *enterprise-level* (see [Testing](#testing-tilck)).

Features
----------------------------------------

Tilck is a preemptable monolithic (but with compile-time modules) *NIX kernel,
implementing about ~100 Linux syscalls (both via `int 0x80` and `sysenter`) on
x86. At its core, the kernel is not x86-centric even if it runs only on x86 at
the moment. Everything arch-specific is isolated. Because of that, most of
kernel's code can be already compiled for any architecture and can be used in
kernel's unit tests.

#### i686 support
While the kernel uses a fair amount of **legacy hardware** like the 8259 PICs for
IRQs, the legacy 8254 PIT for the system timer, the legacy 16550 UART for serial
communication, the 8042 kb controller, the 8237 ISA DMA, and the Sound Blaster
16 sound card (QEMU only), it has also support for some **recent hardware** features
like SSE, AVX and AVX2 fpu instructions, PAT, i686 sysenter, enumeration of PCI Express
devices (via ECAM) and, above all, **ACPI** support via ACPICA. ACPI is currently
used to receive power-button events, to reboot or power-off the machine, and to
read the current parameters of machine's batteries (when implemented via ACPI control
methods).

##### Running on physical x86 hardware
The operating system has been regularly tested on physical hardware from its inception
by booting it with an USB stick (see the notes below). Test machines include actual i686
machines, older x86_64 machines with BIOS-only firmware, newer x86_64 machines with
UEFI+CSM and finally super-recent pure-UEFI machines. For a long time, Tilck's development
strictly complied with the following rule: *if you cannot test it on real hardware, do not
implement it in Tilck*. Only recently, that rule has been relaxed a little in order to play
with SB16. It is possible that, in the future, there might be a few other drivers that
would be tested only on virtual machines: their development is justified by the educational
value it will bring to the operating system and the infrastructure built for them will be
reused for other drivers of the same kind. **But** that will *never* become a common practice.
Tilck is designed to work on real hardware, where any kind of weird things happen. Being
reliable there is *critical* for Tilck's success.

#### riscv64 support

Tilck's support for the riscv64 architecture mainly focuses on embedded applications. Tilck runs
in RV64 supervisor mode (Smode), uses SV39 three-level page table virtual memory, and supports
user space floating point.

##### riscv64 hardware peripheral support

The riscv64 architecture adopts a device tree-based driver model and in Tilck and all
hardware information is obtained from the device tree transmitted by the bootloader. Therefore,
Tilck's riscv kernel code does not have any board-level description code. The system timer
(for ticks) invokes the SBI monitor program (openSBI) through RISCV SBI interface instead of
implementing a driver in the kernel. The system RTC clock is implemented using a very simple
goldfish virtual RTC driver, which works only on the QEMU virtual platform.

Tilck on RISCV does *not* implement typical PC peripherals such as keyboards: for both input
and output serial ports have to be used (which is enough for most embedded applications).
The most common `ns16550` UART driver has been implemented. To better manage the multi-level
nested interrupt architecture common in embedded chips, Tilck on RISCV implements a simplified
framework similar to the idea of Linux IRQ domains. The most common INTC and PLIC interrupt
controller drivers are supported.

##### board support

Tilck on RISCV64 implements a very simple BSP framework, which can be managed by setting environment
variable `BOARD` to build a image of the corresponding board. Currently, Tilck supports only the
[Sipeed licheerv-nano] board and the qemu-virt virtual board (set by default). QEMU-virt has the
framebuffer mode enabled by default, while having FB support on `licheerv-nano` requires patching
the original bootloader provided by Sipeed.

[Sipeed licheerv-nano]: https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html

#### File systems
Tilck has a simple but full-featured (both soft and hard links, file holes, memory
mapping, etc.) **ramfs** implementation, a minimalistic **devfs** implementation,
read-only support for FAT16 and **FAT32** (used for initrd) allowing memory-mapping
of files, and a **sysfs** implementation used to provide a full view of **ACPI's**
**namespace**, the list of all PCI(e) devices and Tilck's compile-time configuration.
Clearly, in order to work with multiple file systems at once, Tilck has a simple
**VFS** implementation as well. **Note**: there is no support for block devices in Tilck
yet, so everything is in-memory.

#### Processes and signals
While Tilck uses internally the concept of thread, multi-threading is not currently
exposed to userspace (kernel threads exist, of course). Both `fork()` and `vfork()` are
properly implemented and copy-on-write is used for fork-ed processes. The `waitpid()`
syscall is fully implemented (which implies process groups etc.). The support for
POSIX signals is partial: custom signal handlers are supported using the `rt_sigaction()`
interface, but most of the SA_* flags are not supported and handlers cannot interrupt
each other, yet. `rt_sigprocmask()`, `sys_rt_sigpending()`, `sys_rt_sigsuspend()`
work as expected, as well as special signals like SIGSTOP, SIGCONT and SIGCHLD.
For more details, see the [syscalls] document.

One interesting feature in this area deserves a special mention: despite the lack of
multi-threading in userspace, Tilck has full support for TLS (thread-local storage) via
`set_thread_area()`, because `libmusl` requires it, even for classic single-threaded
processes.

#### I/O
In addition to the classic `read()` and `write()` syscalls, Tilck supports vectored I/O
via `readv()` and `writev()` as well. In addition to that, non blocking I/O, `select()`
and `poll()` are supported too. Fortunately, no program so far needed `epoll` :-)

#### Console
Tilck has a console supporting more than 90% of Linux's console's features. It works
in the same way (using layers of abstraction) both in text mode and in framebuffer mode.
The effort to implement such a powerful console was driven by the goal to make **Vim** work
smoothly on Tilck, with syntax highlighting etc. While it's true that such a thing has a
little to do with "proper" kernel development, being able to run a "beast" like Vim on a
simple kernel like Tilck, is a great achievement by itself because it shows that Tilck
can run correctly programs having a fair amount of complexity.

#### Userspace applications
Tilck can run a fair amount of console applications like the **BusyBox** suite,
**Vim**, **TinyCC**, **Micropython**, **Lua**, and framebuffer applications like
**fbDOOM** just for fun, despite that being completely out of project's scope.
Check project's [wiki page] for more info about the software that can run on
Tilck.

Booting Tilck
----------------------------------------

### Tilck's bootloader
`Tilck` comes with an interactive bootloader working both on legacy BIOS and on
UEFI systems as well. The bootloader allows the user to choose the desired video
mode, the kernel file itself and to edit kernel's cmdline.

![Tilck's bootloader](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/bootloader.png)

### 3rd-party bootloaders
`Tilck` can be loaded by any bootloader supporting `multiboot 1.0`. For example,
qemu's built-in bootloader works perfectly with `Tilck`:

    qemu-system-i386 -kernel ./build/tilck -initrd ./build/fatpart

Actually that way of booting the kernel is used in the system tests. A shortcut
for it is:

    ./build/run_multiboot_qemu

#### Grub support
`Tilck` can be easily booted with GRUB. Just edit your `/etc/grub.d/40_custom`
file (or create another one) by adding an entry like:

```
menuentry "Tilck" {
    multiboot <PATH-TO-TILCK-BUILD-DIR>/tilck
    module --nounzip <PATH-TO-TILCK-BUILD-DIR>/fatpart
    boot
}
```
After that, just run `update-grub` as root and reboot your machine.

Documentation and HOWTOs
--------------------------

Project's main documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory. However,
[Tilck's wiki](https://github.com/vvaltchev/tilck/wiki) can be used to
navigate through those documention files with the addition of much extra content
like screenshots. Here below, instead, there's a quick *starter* guide, focusing
on the most common scenarios.

### Building Tilck
The project supports a fair amount of build configurations and customizations
but building using its default configuration can be described in just a few
steps. The *only* true requirement for building Tilck is having a Linux
x86_64 host system or Microsoft's `WSL`. Steps:

* Enter project's root directory.
* Build the toolchain (just the first time) with: `./scripts/build_toolchain`
* Compile the kernel and prepare the bootable image with: `make`

At this point, there will be an image file named `tilck.img` in the `build`
directory. The easiest way for actually trying `Tilck` at that point is to run:
`./build/run_qemu`.

#### Running it on physical hardware
The `tilck.img` image is, of course, bootable on physical machines as well,
both on UEFI systems and on legacy ones. Just flush the image file with `dd`
to a usb stick and reboot your machine.

#### Other configurations
To learn much more about how to build and configure Tilck, check the [building]
guide in the `docs/` directory.

[building]: docs/building.md

### Testing Tilck
Tilck has **unit tests**, **kernel self-tests**, **system tests** (using the
syscall interface), and **automated interactive system tests** (simulating real
user input through QEMU's monitor) all in the same repository, completely
integrated with its build system. In addition to that, there's full code
coverage support and useful scripts for generating HTML reports (see the
[coverage] guide). Finally, Tilck is fully integrated with the [Azure Pipelines]
[CI], which validates each pushed branch with builds and test runs in a variety
of configurations. Kernel's coverage data is also uploaded to [CodeCov]. Below,
there are some basic instructions to run most of Tilck's tests. For the whole
story, please read the [testing] document.

[Azure Pipelines]: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines
[CI]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration
[CodeCov]: https://codecov.io

#### Running Tilck's tests
Running Tilck's tests is extremely simple: it just requires to have `python 3`
installed on the machine. For the **self-tests** and the classic
**system tests**, run:

    <BUILD_DIR>/st/run_all_tests -c

To run the **unit tests** instead:

   * Install the [googletest] library (once) with:
     `./scripts/build_toolchain -s build_gtest build_gmock`

   * Build the unit tests with: `make gtests`

   * Run them with: `<BUILD_DIR>/gtests`

To learn much more about Tilck's tests in general and to understand how to run
its *interactive* system tests as well, read the [testing] document.

### Debugging Tilck
With `QEMU`'s integrated `GDB` server, it's possible to debug the Tilck kernel
with GDB almost as if it were a regular process. It just gets tricky when
context switches happen, but GDB cannot help with that. To debug it with GDB,
follow the steps:

  - (Optional) Prepare a debug build of Tilck, for a better debugging experience.

  - Run Tilck's VM with: `./build/run_qemu` but, remain at the bootloader
    stage.

  - In a different terminal, run: `gdb ./build/tilck_unstripped`.

  - In GDB, run: `target remote :1234` to connect to QEMU's gdb server.

  - Set one or more breakpoints using commands like: `break kmain`.

  - Type `c` to allow execution to continue and boot the OS by pressing ENTER
    in the bootloader.

In order to make the debugging experience better, Tilck comes with a set of
**GDB scripts** (see `other/gdb_scripts`). With them, it's super-easy to list
all the tasks on the system, the handles currently opened by any given process
and more. In order to learn how to take advantage of those GDB scripts and anything
else related to debugging the Tilck project, check the [debugging] document.

[debugging]: docs/debugging.md

#### Tilck's debug panel

<img align="right"
src="http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/screenshots/dp04.png"
alt="Tilck's debug panel" width="50%" height="50%">

Debugging Tilck with GDB while it's running inside a VM is very convenient, but
in other cases (e.g. Tilck on real hardware) we don't have GDB support. In
addition to that, even when the kernel is running inside a VM, there are some
features that are just much more convient to expose directly from the kernel
itself rather than through GDB scripts. One way to expose kernel info to
userspace is to use `sysfs`, but that's not necessarily the most convenient way
for everything (still, Tilck does have [sysfs] implementation), especially when
*interaction* with the kernel itself is needed for debugging purposes. To help
in those cases, a *debug panel* has been introduced inside Tilck itself. It
started as something like Linux's [Magic SysRq] which evolved in a sort of TUI
application with debug info plus tracing capabilities for user processes. In the
future, it will support some proper debugging features as well. To learn more
about it, check the the [debugging] document.

A comment about user experience
----------------------------------

Tilck particularly distinguishes itself from many open source projects in one
way: it really cares about the **user experience** (where "user" means
"developer"). It's not the typical super-cool low-level project that's insanely
complex to build and configure; it's not a project requiring 200 things to be
installed on the host machine. Building such projects may require hours or even
days of effort (think about special configurations e.g. building with a
cross-compiler). Tilck instead, has been designed to be trivial to build and
test even by inexperienced people with basic knowledge of Linux. It has a
sophisticated script for building its own toolchain that works on all the major
Linux distributions and a powerful CMake-based build system. The build of Tilck
produces an image ready to be tested with QEMU or written on a USB stick. (To
some degree, it's like what the `buildroot` project does for Linux, but it's
much simpler.) Finally, the project includes also scripts for running Tilck
on QEMU with various configurations (BIOS boot, UEFI boot, direct (multi-)boot
with QEMU's `-kernel` option, etc.).

#### Motivation
The reason for having the above mentioned features is to offer its users and
potential contributors a really **nice** experience, avoiding any kind of
frustration. Hopefully, even the most experienced engineers will enjoy a zero
effort experience. But it's not all about reducing the frustration. It's also
about _not scaring_ students and junior developers who might be just curious to
see what this project is all about and maybe eager to write a simple program for
it and/or add a couple of `printk()`'s here and there in their fork. Hopefully,
some of those people *just playing* with Tilck might actually want to contribute
to its development.

In conclusion, even if some parts of the project itself are be pretty complex,
at least building and running its tests **must be** something anyone can do.
