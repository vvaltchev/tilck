## Debugging the kernel with GDB
As explained in the README.md file, it's easy to debug Tilck's kernel while it's
running inside a QEMU virtual machine. By default, the `run_qemu` script
runs `QEMU` with the `-s` option, a shorthand for `-gdb tcp::1234`. Therefore,
once Tilck has booted we can connect with GDB as if we'd do for any other process
debugged remotely:

```
$ gdb ./build/tilck_unstripped
Reading symbols from ./build/tilck_unstripped...
(gdb) target remote :1234
Remote debugging using :1234
need_reschedule () at /home/vlad/dev/tilck/include/tilck/kernel/sched.h:154
154	   return atomic_load_explicit(&__need_resched, mo_relaxed);
(gdb)
```

Or, we can set a breakpoint to `kmain()` during the boot stage and then allow
the VM to run, in order to debug the kernel during its initialization. One detail
omitted in README.md is that we can change the port number used by QEMU's GDB
server using the GDB_PORT environment variable:

```
GDB_PORT=9999 ./build/run_qemu
```

Another detail omitted in the README.md is that running `run_qemu` without
`-enable-kvm` is necessary, even if we have `KVM` installed on the machine.
That's because QEMU has *limited* support for debugging VMs using
hardware-virtualization. For example, it happens that breakpoints are missed.

### Custom GDB commands
One "detail" omitted until now is that running GDB like explained, triggers
a warning about the auto-loading of GDB scripts found in *unsafe* locations
like:

```
Reading symbols from ./build/tilck_unstripped...
warning: File "/home/vlad/dev/tilck/build/tilck_unstripped-gdb.py" auto-loading has been declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
To enable execution of this file add
        add-auto-load-safe-path /home/vlad/dev/tilck/build/tilck_unstripped-gdb.py
line to your configuration file "/home/vlad/.gdbinit".
To completely disable this security protection add
        set auto-load safe-path /
line to your configuration file "/home/vlad/.gdbinit".
For more information about this security protection see the
"Auto-loading safe path" section in the GDB manual.  E.g., run from the shell:
        info "(gdb)Auto-loading safe path"
```

To allow GDB to load our custom script, add the following line in your `~/.gdbinit`
file:

```
add-auto-load-safe-path <ABSOLUTE-PATH-OF-TILCK-BUILD-DIRECTORY>
```

Also, for a better debug experience add also:

```
set print pretty on
```

After that, GDB won't complain anymore and it will load Tilck's custom GDB script,
as expected and the `tilck_unstripped-gdb.py` GDB script will import other scripts
from the `other/gdb_scripts` directory.

The scripts will add both custom pretty printers and custom commands. Plus,
there's a special command called `list-tilck-cmds` to list all the custom
commands:

```
Reading symbols from ./build/tilck_unstripped...
(gdb) list-tilck-cmds
list-tasks
list-procs
list-tilck-cmds
get-task
get-proc
get-handle2
get-handle
get-curr
get-currp
(gdb)
```

#### list-tasks
This command will enlist all the tasks on the system:

```
(gdb) list-tasks

$14 = (struct task *) 0xc0062c00
        {tid =     1, pid =     1, SLEEPING, cmdline = /initrd/bin/init}

$15 = (struct task *) 0xc7b82400
        {tid =    36, pid =    36, SLEEPING, cmdline = /bin/ash}

$16 = (struct task *) 0xc7b83000
        {tid =    37, pid =    37, SLEEPING, cmdline = /initrd/bin/init}

$17 = (struct task *) 0xc7b83400
        {tid =    38, pid =    38, SLEEPING, cmdline = /initrd/bin/init}

        ------------------ Kernel threads ------------------

$18 = (struct task *) 0xc01f8d00 <buf+36096>
        {tid = 10001, RUNNABLE, kthread_name = wth_run}

$19 = (struct task *) 0xc01f9200 <buf+37376>
        {tid = 10002, RUNNABLE, kthread_name = wth_run}

$20 = (struct task *) 0xc01f9900 <buf+39168>
        {tid = 10004, SLEEPING, kthread_name = fb_blink_thread}

$21 = (struct task *) 0xc01f9a00 <buf+39424>
        {tid = 10005, SLEEPING, kthread_name = fb_update_banner}

$22 = (struct task *) 0xc01f9b00 <buf+39680>
        {tid = 10006, RUNNING, kthread_name = idle}

$23 = (struct task *) 0xc01f9e00 <buf+40448>
        {tid = 10007, SLEEPING, kthread_name = wth_run}

$24 = (struct task *) 0xc01f9f00 <buf+40704>
        {tid = 10008, SLEEPING, kthread_name = clock_drift_adj}

$25 = (struct task *) 0xc002bd00
        {tid = 10010, SLEEPING, kthread_name = wth_run}

$26 = (struct task *) 0xc0062100
        {tid = 10011, SLEEPING, kthread_name = wth_run}

(gdb)
```

#### list-procs
Similar to `list-tasks`, but it will show just the user processes. Note: while
for the moment there's no multi-threading support, in the future there might be
and, each user process might be associated to more than 1 task (thread).

```
(gdb) list-procs

$27 = (struct process *) 0xc0062cb0
        { pid =     1, cmdline = '/initrd/bin/init' }

$28 = (struct process *) 0xc7b824b0
        { pid =    36, cmdline = '/bin/ash' }

$29 = (struct process *) 0xc7b830b0
        { pid =    37, cmdline = '/initrd/bin/init' }

$30 = (struct process *) 0xc7b834b0
        { pid =    38, cmdline = '/initrd/bin/init' }

(gdb)
```

#### get-proc PID
Dump the `struct process` for the process `PID`.

```
(gdb) get-proc 1
$34 = *(struct process *) 0xc0062cb0 = {

(gdb)
```

#### get-handle2 PID HANDLE
Dump the base handle struct for the given handle.

```
(gdb) get-handle2 1 0
$35 = *(struct fs_handle_base *) 0xc00615c0 = {

  fl_flags   = 32768,
  spec_flags = (none),
  pos        = 0
}
```

#### get-handle HANDLE
Exactly like `get-handle2`, but assumes as PID the current one.

#### get-curr
Dump the `struct task` of the current task.

```
(gdb) get-curr
$39 = *(struct task *) 0xc01f9b00 = {

  }
}
(gdb)
```

#### get-currp
Like `get-curr`, but dumps the `struct process`. Note: in this case, pid is 0
because the current task is a kernel thread, therefore `get-currp` dumps the
special `kernel_process_pi` object.

```
(gdb) get-currp
$38 = *(struct process *) 0xc0212290 = {
  pid                 = 0,
  cmdline             = (null),
  parent_pid          = 0,
  pgid                = 0,
  sid                 = 0,
  brk                 = 0x0,
  initial_brk         = 0x0,
  children            = {1},
  did_call_execve     = false,
  vforked             = false,
  inherited_mmap_heap = false,
  str_cwd             = "/",
  handles             = {},
  mi                  = (null)
}
```

## Tilck's debug panel
As mentioned in the README.md file, Tilck has a nice developer-only feature called
**debug panel** or **dp**. To open it, just run the `dp` *wrapper* program.

![Tilck's debug panel](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/screenshots/dp01.png)

Using it is trivial: just switch tabs using the digits and scroll up and down their
content using the `PAGE_UP` and `PAGE_DOWN` keys. Its most interesting feature is
probably its embedded **syscall tracer**. To use it, first go to the `tasks` tab.

![Tilck's debug panel](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/screenshots/dp04.png)

Then, enter in *select mode* by pressing ENTER and select a user process. After that,
mark it as *traced* by pressing `t`. Finally, enter in *tracing mode* by pressing `Ctrl+T`.
In alternative, it's possible to enter in tracing mode directly by running `tracer`. Once
there, press `h` for the help menu.

![Tilck's debug panel](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/screenshots/tracing01.png)

Once there, press `ENTER` to start/stop the syscall tracing.

This whole feature is particularly useful if the debug panel is run on a serial console:
this way its possibile to see at the same time the traced program *and* its syscall trace.
To do that, run the `qemu` VM this way:

    ./build/run_qemu -serial pty

In addition to the VM window, you'll see on the terminal something like:

    char device redirected to /dev/pts/4 (label serial0)

Open another virtual terminal, install `screen` if you don't have it, and run:

    screen /dev/pts/4

You'll just connect to a Tilck serial console. Just press ENTER there and run
`dp` as previously explained.

![Tilck's debug panel](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/screenshots/tracing02.png)

Note: recent versions of QEMU (>= 4.0) have a built-in serial console that can be
opened by using its GUI, without special command-line options and without using the
`screen` application.

## Debugging Tilck's bootloader
While Tilck's bootloader looks and behaves the same way no matter if we did a
classic BIOS boot or a UEFI boot, internally there are two bootloaders with
fundamentally different implementations, compiled in a completely different way
which just share the main logic (see `common_bootloader_logic()`) using a
an interface implemented by the two variants (see `struct bootloader_intf`).
Therefore, from now on, we should talk either about the *legacy* bootloader or
about the *UEFI* bootloader.

### Debugging the legacy bootloader
The legacy bootloader has 3 stages. Initially, the BIOS loads its first stage
(512 bytes) at a predefined address and jumps into it in x86 [real mode]. There,
we relocate to a different segment and load both the 2nd and the 3rd stages at
once in a way that's AS IF everything were loaded at once in a contiguous chunk
of memory. After that, we jump to the 2nd stage. In the 2nd stage, we enter in
[protected mode] and jump into the 3rd stage.

[real mode]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode
[protected mode]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode

With GDB we cannot really debug code running in [real mode], but the good thing is
that the 1st and the 2nd stages are small part of the legacy bootloader and should
never really need to be touched. Therefore, we'll talk only about debugging the 3rd
stage, which runs in 32-bit [protected mode] like the whole Tilck kernel and it's
also mostly written in C. Steps:

  * Run: `./build/run_qemu -S`. The `-S` option will force QEMU to stop
    before the boot stage.

  * In a different console, run GDB with:
    `gdb ./build/boot/legacy/stage3/elf_stage3_unstripped`

  * Connect to remote GDB server with: `target remote :1234`

  * Place a breakpoint in the early entry code (`_start`) or in the C main
    function (`bootloader_main()`).

  * Allow the VM to run with the `continue` GDB command.

  * Debug as usual. Note: avoid stepping inside `realmode_call()` because it
    makes the CPU to enter in (un)real mode (mostly undebuggable with GDB) and
    then to re-enter in [protected mode].

### Debugging the UEFI bootloader
The setup for debugging the UEFI bootloader is quite different from anything
we've seen so far. First of all, since UEFI applications are shared libraries
that can be loaded by the firmware anywhere in system's memory, we need to get
from the bootloader itself its *base address* in order to debug the application.
To do that, we need first to enable the `EFI_BOOTLOADER_DEBUG` CMake config
option (see the [building] doc to learn how to do that). After that, we'll
run GDB and pass that *BaseAddr* to it, while loading the shared library using
the `add-symbol-file` command:

  * Enable the `EFI_BOOTLOADER_DEBUG` config option

  * Run QEMU: `./build/run_efi_qemu32`. The bootloader will stop early
    displaying a similar to the following:

    ```
    ------------ EFI BOOTLOADER DEBUG ------------
    Pointer size:  4
    JumpToKernel:  0x61392F3
    BaseAddr:      0x6137000
    Press ANY key to continue...
    ```

  * Run GDB without arguments: `gdb`

  * Connect to QEMU's gdb server with: `target remote :1234`

  * Add the EFI's app `.so` file at the right address:
    `add-symbol-file build/boot/efi/ia32/libefi_app_ia32.so <BaseAddr>`

  * Set your breakpoints and say GDB to continue the execution

  * Press a key in QEMU's window

  * Enjoy debugging with GDB!

To debug the 64-bit EFI bootloader, run `run_efi_qemu64` and use the file
`build/boot/efi/x86_64/libefi_app_x86_64.so` for symbols. It's worth noticing
that, virtually there should be no reason to do that and that it won't be
possible to debug with GDB the i386 kernel when running on a x86_64 QEMU virtual
machine. See [bug 1686170] on launchpad.net.

#### Details about BaseAddr
By looking at the body of the `if (EFI_BOOTLOADER_DEBUG)` statement, some readers
might notice that `BaseAddr` has a `0x1000` (4 KB) offset from EFI's ImageBase.
That's because the first load segment starts at that offset n the ELF file:

```
$ readelf -l ./build/boot/efi/ia32/libefi_app_ia32.so

Elf file type is DYN (Shared object file)
Entry point 0x8200
There are 4 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:
  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align
  LOAD           0x001000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x0dd60 0x0dd60 R E 0x1000
  LOAD           0x00f000 0x0000e000 0x0000e000 0x0e7bb 0x0e7bb RW  0x1000
  DYNAMIC        0x019000 0x00018000 0x00018000 0x000a0 0x000a0 RW  0x4
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RWE 0x10

 Section to Segment mapping:
  Segment Sections...
   00     .hash .text .plt
   01     .sdata .data .dynamic .rel .rel.plt .dynsym .dynstr
   02     .dynamic
   03
```

And GDB expects the address of the first load segment (anything before that isn't
supposed to be loaded in memory). While in theory that offset might change if the
ELF headers get bigger, in practice that will never happen as long as we don't add
new sections and segments in the binary (and we don't have a reason to do that).
Therefore, it's reasonable fine to just hard-code that +0x1000 offset for the sake
of simplicity instead of having to add it manually or to implement any sort of tricky
solutions supporting it to change.
