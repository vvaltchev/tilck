Testing Tilck
------------------------

The project has four types of tests:

   * [Unit tests](#unit-tests): the arch-independent part of the kernel (most of
     it) is built as a static library for the *host* architecture and linked
     together with all the C and C++ files in `tests/unit` and the [googletest]
     library.

   * [System tests](#system-tests): classic system tests using the syscall
     interface. Their source is located in `tests/system`. All those files are
     linked together as part of the `devshell` user application.

   * [Kernel self-tests](#kernel-self-tests): a special type of tests built as
     part of the kernel itself, runnable through a special Tilck syscall. They
     are located in the `tests/self` directory.

   * [Interactive tests](#interactive-tests): a special type of tests that
     simulate real user input via a virtual PS/2 keyboard (through QEMU's
     monitor) and parse the actual graphical output of Tilck's framebuffer
     console, comparing it to an expected text screen. Have something in
     common with [output comparison testing] (see below for more).

Unit tests
-------------

Unit tests are a *must* for each software project. They offer a simple way to
test portable code in a controlled environment, completely outside of
the *real* project. That's super convenient because there's no kernel involved:
just a simple Linux binary. The downside of unit tests is that they cannot test
low-level code, requiring real (or virtual) hardware. Mock-ups help to overcome
most of those limitations and are used in this project but still, unit tests
cannot replace other kinds of testing. Said that, most of the code *can* and
*shall be* be tested this way.

![Tilck's unit tests](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/gtests.png)

#### How the unit tests are compiled
As mentioned above, Tilck's unit tests are compiled by linking together a static
library made by compiling kernel's arch-independent code for the *host*
architecture, plus the files in `tests/unit`. It is important to remark what
building for the *host* architecture means: the kernel code *and* the tests must
build on *any* architecture, even if Tilck has no support it, simply because
they are made by *portable* code. For example, while *currently* Tilck has no
ARM support, its unit tests build and run just fine on any ARM machine running
Linux.

The testing framework used is [googletest] and all the tests are written in
C++11. That's because C++'s abstractions are very convenient for writing tests
in a shorter and more expressive way compared to C. Also, the overhead of having
temporary C++ objects created, copied, and destroyed (even quite often) is
*insignificant* compared to the overhead of starting a VM for running the kernel
itself. The unit tests are the *fastest* way of testing Tilck's code at runtime:
currently, the whole suite passes in **under 4 seconds**, using the slowest debug
build and in **under 2 seconds** in the case of release builds.

#### Prerequisites
In order to build the unit tests, it is necessary to download and build the
[googletest] library in Tilck's toolchain. To do that, just run:

    ./scripts/build_toolchain -s build_gtest

#### Build and run
Building the unit tests is as simple as running:

    make gtests

And running them is simple as:

    ./build/gtests

It's worth noticing that the [googletest] framework offers nice command-line
options such as `--gtest_filter`. To list them all, just run the executable
with the `--help` option. For out-of-tree builds and other build-related topics,
check the dedicated [building] document.

#### Special configurations
Despite unit tests' the code built is supposed to be portable, sometimes
subtle portability bugs issues come out. For example, because the host machine
is always x86_64 and Tilck's only target architecture for the moment is i686,
that means that unit tests are never built on 32-bit machines, while the kernel
noarch code is built both for 32-bit and for 64-bit machines. To make the unit
tests robust against any kind of 32/64 bit portability issues, a special option
has been introduced in Tilck's build system: `ARCH_GTESTS`. When it's enabled,
the unit tests are built for the *target* architecture instead. Of course, in
the general case we cannot run those tests on the *host* machine, but in the
lucky x86 case we actually *can* do that. Such build configuration is part of
the CI testing and helped discover and fix a fair amount of portability issues.

To build the unit tests for the *target* architecture, first build the
[googletest] framework for that architecture with:

    ./scripts/build_toolchain -s build_gtest_arch

And then enable the `ARCH_GTESTS` CMake option (see [building] document to
learn how to that).

System tests
---------------

Tilck's system tests are exactly what everybody would expect as a primary way of
testing a kernel: userspace applications executing syscalls and checking their
effect. In this case, all of them are part of one single binary, called
`devshell`. That app is a trivial shell that was actually used in the past as a
shell when Tilck was not ready to run Busybox's `ASH` yet. Today, it's used
just as a runner for `shellcmds`, an *internal name* for system tests. The
source code of `devshell` is split between `userapps/devshell`, which contains
application's core and the individual *shellcmds*, which are located in
`tests/system`.

![Tilck's devshell](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/devshell.png)

#### Running the tests on Tilck

One way of running those tests is to do that directly on Tilck. Just run:

    runall

That works because `runall` is a symlink to `devshell` and it's equivalent to
running:

    devshell -c runall

Of course, any specific test can be run instead of `runall` in the same way:

    devshell -c <TESTNAME>

It's possible to list all the tests in a human-friendly form by running
`devshell` and then `help` or by running: `devshell -c help`. Tilck's test
infrastructure instead, runs `devshell -l`.

![Tilck's system tests](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/runall.png)

#### Running the tests with the runner

Another way of running Tilck's system tests is using `run_all_tests`: a python
script designed to run multiple types of tests. Due to its versatility, it is
possible that *in the future* it will be able to run *all* the types of tests
supported in the Tilck project. Back to the topic, running just the classic
system tests is simple as:

    <BUILD_DIR>/st/run_all_tests -T shellcmd

It essential to remark that, by default, this script runs *each* test in a
dedicated VM. This means, powering on a QEMU virtual machine, booting Tilck, and
only then running just a single test. It is *slow*, but not so much: all of that
happens in **less than 1 second** on a typical laptop (using KVM) and currently,
all the tests way pass in less than 1 minute (slowest debug build). The main
advantage of this approach is that if the kernel crashes on a single test, we'll
still have it tested on all the other cases. Another advantage is that there's
a *strict* timeout for each test, enforced by the test runner itself and, in case
of timeout, the VM is killed. Despite that, it is still desirable being able to
run all the system tests by powering just one VM; to do that, just add the `-c`
option to command above:

    <BUILD_DIR>/st/run_all_tests -T shellcmd -c

In this case, the runner will just run `devshell -c runall` as we saw above.
In case of a failure, we'll still see the whole output but, the runner will
consider `runall` as one test, in the *tests passed* report at the end. Also,
the whole run will have a single timeout from the runner's point of view.

![Tilck's test runner](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/runner01.png)

#### Runner's other options

The runner supports a variety of other options. Check them with `--help`.
One of them is, indeed, `-T` which allows us to specify the test type. Running
the command above without `-T shellcmd` will work but it will *also* run the
kernel self-tests and any other kind of tests eventually supported. With the
`-l` option it is possible to list the tests matching the current criteria
(dry-run), while with the `-f` option it is possible to filter the tests using
a regex.

#### The "extra" special test

While anything part of the kernel/userspace interface can be tested with *shellcmds*
as described above, sometimes that's simply not very convenient to do. For example,
to check that BusyBox's `tar` works as expected on Tilck, it would be nicer to use
a shell script instead of writing a test in C. That's why a special shellcmd called
`extra` has been introduced. It's just a mini test-runner for all the scripts in
`tests/system/scripts`. It fails when a script fails (exits with a code different
than 0). This "special" shellcmd is actually a regular shellcmd from the point of
view of the test infrastructure and can be run the same way as all the other tests
of the same type.


Kernel self-tests
-------------------

Tilck's self-tests are, roughly speaking, just a bunch of kernel functions that
our `devshell` run by calling a special syscall, `sys_tilck_cmd()`. Their source
is located in the `tests/self` directory. By default, they're built-in Tilck, on
any configuration except when `TINY_KERNEL` is enabled. To compile them out of the
kernel's binary, just disable the `KERNEL_SELFTESTS` CMake option (see [building]).

## Running the self-tests

Because a failure in a *kernel* self-test means almost always a kernel panic,
most of the time it isn't very convenient to run them manually in Tilck. Also,
because the self-tests *by definition* check the correctness of *core* kernel
features like mutexes, there's no safe way (in general) to impose a timeout
and *safely kill* the test when it's taking too long to complete: that can be
done safely only from *outside* the kernel itself.

Because of all of that, it is better to run the self-tests with the `run_all_tests`
runner, on the host machine: it will power on a VM for each test and, of course,
it will kill the VM in case of a timeout. To do that, run:

    <BUILD_DIR>/st/run_all_tests -T selftest

To list all the self-tests run:

    <BUILD_DIR>/st/run_all_tests -T selftest -l

## Running the self-tests directly on Tilck

In some special cases, it *does* make sense to run some self-tests directly on
Tilck, especially the *perf* ones. Those tests are actually *performance* tests,
not *functional* ones. A classic test of this kind is `kmalloc_perf`, introduced
to measure the performance of Tilck's memory allocator. To run it or any other
self-test directly on Tilck, use the `selftest` symlink to `devshell` this way:

    selftest <test-name>

Some tests like `kmalloc_perf` are affected a lot by the optimization level.
If you run them on Tilck, you'll see quite a difference between regular DEBUG
builds and optimized RELEASE builds with `DEBUG_CHECKS=0` (see [building]).
One more nice thing about the `kmalloc_perf` test is that it can be run
as a unit test as well. In particular, if the unit tests are built for the
same *target* architecture as the kernel itself (using `ARCH_GTESTS=1`, see
[Unit tests](#unit-tests) (above) and [building]), we can reproduce on the
*host* machine a performance test with results very close to what we get can
on get Tilck: that makes a lot easier to measure and improve the implementation
of any piece of kernel code.

Interactive tests
-------------------

#### Introduction
While it would be great to test the whole kernel just using the above-mentioned
test types, sometimes that's not possible. Consider the PS/2 keyboard driver:
its code is *never* covered during the system tests because they use the serial
port for input/output and that's not a defect: that's the *right* way to fetch
the output from system tests. Simply, even the *right* way have some inevitable
limitations. While it's true that with some serious mocking it would be possible
to test part of the PS/2 driver in unit tests, that's not very convenient and
it's far too *unrealistic*: no IRQs, no (real or emulated) 8042 controller, etc.
A better way is to test it against a *reference* implementation like the one in
QEMU but, how to do that? QEMU's monitor has an interface for sending keystrokes
to the VM, but the real problem is the following: when Tilck's console gets its
input from the PS/2 keyboard, its output goes to the default (video) monitor,
not to the serial port and that's how it should be. In order to check if the
output produced after a given input is correct, the test infrastructure needs
somehow to compare what's on the (virtual) screen with something expected. In
other words, that means comparing images and that's pretty problematic.

#### Why comparing images is bad
It should be clear at this point that testing some code-paths in the kernel
requires somehow to compare images to check the correctness of the output and
that's pretty bad, as the intuition might suggest. Comparing images as binary
blobs is easy but *extremely fragile* because even if a *single* pixel
differs, the whole test will fail. This issue can be mitigated by avoiding
mutable elements on the screen (e.g. date/time info) but the problem is still
there because small and innocent changes will break such tests. In addition to
that, images take space and that creates logistic challenges as well: where to
store the set of expected images (screenshots)? Project's git repository doesn't
look like a good place for that purpose. Create a dedicated "assets" git repo and
use git sub-modules or make the scripts to download the "assets" from somewhere
else? How to keep everything in sync? All of those approaches could work with
enough effort, but none of them is in Tilck's minimalistic/extra-light style.

#### Tilck's approach
What would be really cool is to work with VM screenshots the same way we do with
plain text because, after all, we're always only interested in the text contained
in those images, nothing else. So, the solution is to use an OCR, right?
**Wrong**: OCRs are big, bloated, and tend to be not very reliable even with
purely digitally-generated images, like in this case. A **perfect** solution
would be to have a custom OCR that knows exactly the font used by Tilck and take
advantage of that to do an image-to-text conversion in a **100% reliable** way.
While that initially seemed hard to do, it turned out that it required just a
few hundred lines of C code (also thanks to the fact that QEMU saves screenshots
in the [PPM] file format). That's how the [pnm2text] tool was born.

Now, with a perfect image-to-text conversion not only it's trivial to do exact
output comparisons like in the case of [output comparison testing], but we can
also define tests that just search for a series of words in the output and,
based on that, define test's outcome as *pass* or *fail*. Both kinds of tests
exist in Tilck.

#### Running the interactive tests (advanced)
Tilck's interactive tests require a special build configuration and extra
packages in the toolchain. Please check [building] before proceeding further.

**Steps**

   - Check that you have [ImageMagick] installed on the system

   - Check and install the list of extra packages required for the special build
     in the `cmake_run` script (look for the `--intr` option). Currently, only
     `vim` is required.

   - Create a dedicated build directory and enter there

   - Run: `<TILCK>/cmake_run --intr`

   - Build the kernel as always with `make`

   - Run the tests with: `./st/run_interactive_test -a`

In case of an incompatible configuration, it will fail by reporting one or
multiple INVALID CONFIG errors like:

    [interactive tests runner] INVALID CONFIG: expected EXTRA_VIM to be `True`
    [interactive tests runner] INVALID CONFIG: expected FB_CONSOLE_BANNER to be `False`
    [interactive tests runner] INVALID CONFIG: expected FB_CONSOLE_CURSOR_BLINK to be `False`

![Tilck screenshots](http://vvaltchev.github.io/tilck_imgs/v2/interactive03.png)

**Using the top runner**

It is certainly possible and convenient to use the main runner (`run_all_tests`)
for the interactive tests as well. That's because of its filter feature and
because it displays the output of a test run only in case of a failure: it is
*higher-level* tool, designed to run *many* tests. To run the interactive tests
with it, just execute:

    ./st/run_all_tests -T interactive -t any

Notes:

   1. It is necessary to use the `-t` option because the timeout length of
      interactive tests is higher than the default timeout used by the runner.

   2. In case of a **configuration incompatible** with interactive tests, the
      runner will just say that there aren't any tests matching the criteria.
      Also, listing all the tests with `-L` won't mention the interactive tests
      at all. That's because, 99% of the time people won't use a build config
      for interactive tests: as mentioned before, these are a kind of *exotic*
      type of tests and if there are not available, that's perfectly fine.

   3. To run the interactive tests along with all the other tests as well, just
      drop the `-T interactive` option. Keep in mind that doing so will also run
      the `long` shellcmd tests. Set a timeout different than `any` to avoid that.
      Checking the list of all tests with `-L` and the timeout labels with `-j`
      will help.
