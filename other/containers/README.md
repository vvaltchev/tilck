The file structure follows docker standards, and every container can be created
by a Dockerfile that sits in a directory is named after the container's name.
The reasoning behind this structure is allowing syntax highlighting for all IDEs
(see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27409761/docker-multiple-dockerfiles-in-project)).
To build and tag an image from the root folder of the project, just use
```bash
docker build -t <username>/<container_name>:<version> \
other/containers/<container_name>
```
Then, to actually run the image in a container in interactive mode use
```bash
docker run -it <username>/<container_name> bash
```
